# Tomatix Timer

## Why Tomatix?

- **Simple & Effective**: No clutter, no distractions—just a timer that helps you focus.
- **DND Workflow**: Tired of using "*pleb*" focus timers that demand notifications stay ON, letting emails and messages ruin your flow? **Tomatix** flips the script—focus deeply, and fullscreen alerts will call you back when it’s break time.
- **Built to Work**: Developed while using it, so it’s practical and reliable.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install Tomatix
pip install .
```
